## Relationship between SES and Math Scores

This section will look at the relationship between socioeconomic status and math 
scores.  Blah blah blah.  


```{r}

hsb2 %>%
    group_by(ses) %>%
    summarize(mean(math), median(math), sd(math), min(math), max(math))

```

Now let's do a plot.

```{r}

hsb2 %>%
    group_by(ses) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = ses, y = math)) +
    geom_boxplot()

```
